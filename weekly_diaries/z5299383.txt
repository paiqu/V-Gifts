# Work Diary
## Week 1
Group formed. I created the Jira account.  

We discussed the project, and decided to do the E-Commerce recommender system project. 

I wrote some user stories for the chatbot feature.

## Week 2
I added epic and user stories to Jira.  

We further discussed the topic of the project and potential innovative ideas. We haven't come up with a good innovative idea because it seems that current e-commerce website has covered most features. We will continue discussing until we find one.


## Week 3
This week we finish our proposal.

I added and rephrased some epics and user stories.

Coding will start next week.

  1. HomePage

  3. ProfilePage
  4. AdminPage
