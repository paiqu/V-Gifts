# Work Diary
## Week 1
Group formed. I created the Jira account.  

We discussed the project, and decided to do the E-Commerce recommender system project. 

I wrote some user stories for the chatbot feature.

## Week 2
I added epic and user stories to Jira.  

We further discussed the topic of the project and potential innovative ideas. We haven't come up with a good innovative idea because it seems that current e-commerce website has covered most features. We will continue discussing until we find one.


## Week 3
This week we finish our proposal.

I added and rephrased some epics and user stories.

Coding will start next week.

## Week 4
This week I design and implement the frontend of our website using HTML and CSS:
  1. HomePage
  2. ProductsPage
  3. ProfilePage
  4. AdminPage

We used a google doc to distribute our work

Next week I will transfer our website to a React app and connect our frontend to the backend.

## Week 5
This week I transferred our frontend from Bootstrap to React app.

React router is used to navigate among pages.

I also modified the design of the frontend. The main color was switched to yellow and blue.

Admin page done. In admin's portal, admin can manage the messages, orders, users and products of the website.
